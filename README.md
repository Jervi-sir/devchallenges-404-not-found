## Overview

### Where can I see your demo

- You can click on the link her --> [Demo](https://devchallenges-404-not-found-138m0slv8.vercel.app/)

### What was your experience

- It took a while for me to complete this challenge, I wasted a lot of time thinking and worrying whether the steps and method that I am going to make the responsive demo is correct. Rather than thinkering whether it is correct or wrong, why not JUST DO IT! It does not have to be perfect, beside I am still learning. I am sure there are alot of experience people that will help and provide me with feedbacks if my methods are not correct.

### What have you learned/improved

- In the process of this challenge, initially I use css property of flex to align and segment the components. At a later part I decided why not try using grid? There are pros and cons in deciding which css property to use, by using grid i eliminate a few class wrapper which makes the html markup much more simpler. What to improve? I guess I need to be less of a perfectionist and more of putting the work out.

### Finding wisdom

- I get wisdom from [Thu Nghiem's blog](https://blogs.devchallenges.io/posts/IrZfHhYWIoKb4QuHa2k8) where i read more about BEM , dev.to blog [Zell Liew CSS Reset](https://dev.to/zellwk/my-css-reset--jbp?signin=true) on CSS Reset, [Kevin Powell The Responsive Web Design Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/responsive) Responsive Design Course which I enrolled. I also wanted to test on what I have learn and implement the knowledge on my project. Devchallenges.io is just what I have been looking for. Thank you Thu Nghiem for making this platform, BRILLIANT!
